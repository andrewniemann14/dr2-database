# scraper:
Python program scrapes official website for challenge and leaderboard data, saves results to JSON files

'requests' library not allowed on Hostgator, so it has to be done locally and the JSON files FTP'd to the inserter
eventually I'll find a solution to get it running online and automatically


# inserter:
PHP program inserts JSON data into a MySQL database
